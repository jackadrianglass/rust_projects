# Bank tracking

Basically take a bank statement from the RBC online app and pass it through
this application and it spits out a monthly statement about how you spend
your money monthly. The goal is to have an interactive prompt for you to
quickly sort through all your expenses so that you actually look at the
individual expenses that you're making on the regular.

# TODO

      you can view in all of its glory
