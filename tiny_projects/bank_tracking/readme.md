# Bank tracking

Basically take a bank statement from the RBC online app and pass it through
this application and it spits out a monthly statement about how you spend
your money monthly. The goal is to have an interactive prompt for you to
quickly sort through all your expenses so that you actually look at the
individual expenses that you're making on the regular.

# TODO

- [ ] Add income tracking
- [ ] Add undo operation for the sorting stuff
- [ ] Seperate the income from the rest of the expenses in the report
- [ ] Add an environment file to specify the storage directories and backup directories
